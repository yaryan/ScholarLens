At intermediate couplings, two trends appear: For J\u22a5 \u2272 2, vertical links are too weak to fully synchronize layers. Avalanches remain predominantly lateral, and the 3D distributions recover a broad algebraic regime (LRO), similar to the in\u2013plane case. For J\u22a5 > 2 but \u03b3 \u223c 1, memory weakens while vertical links are mod- erately strong; partial inter-layer merging also produces power-law distributions of avalanches corresponding to LRO. As \u03b3 increases further, activity becomes sparse, producing a crossover regime which eventually gives way to short\u2013range behavior when \u03b3 is too large. Taken together, the 3D clusters make explicit the mechanism behind MILRO drag: vertical coupling links together correlated planes. When J\u22a5 is strong, this ef- fect yields stack\u2013spanning events (rigidity); when mod- erate, it transmits order without full synchronization (LRO/crossover); and when weak, layers decouple and only small clusters survive. --- Page 13 --- 13 Rigid Long-range order Crossover Short-range correlations FIG. 10.

Divergences 4 4 4 1 appear at J\u22a5 = 2J and J\u22a5 = 4J when the inter-layer and intra-layer spin-glass interactions are in opposition, and in these cases, flips can only occur within a particular range of J\u22a5.

This average flipping extraction approaches. time \u27e8\u2206t\u27e9 as a function of J\u22a5 is plotted in Fig. 6(b), with J =1 fixed. As expected, \u27e8\u2206t\u27e9 is less than 1 when J\u22a5 is not too close to 2J or 4J, but near these values, the flipping timescale diverges. Appendix B: Numerical details We simulate Eqn. 1 on k square layers of size L\u00d7L stacked along the feedforward direction. Unless stated otherwise, open boundaries are used in-plane and all parameters are homogeneous within a layer. Time evolution is integrated with a fixed\u2013step, fourth\u2013order Runge\u2013Kutta scheme using \u2206t = 0.048\u03b31/3, which re- solves both the fast spin dynamics and the slow mem- ory dynamics over the range of \u03b3 explored. To elimi- nate transients, we discard the first 103 steps and record the subsequent trajectory for avalanche analysis. For each {\u03b3,J\u22a5}, avalanches are collected over multiple dis- order realizations of {J(k),J\u22a5(k)} and independent ran- ij i dom seeds.
