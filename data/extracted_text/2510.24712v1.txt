--- Page 1 --- Memory-induced long-range order drag Yuan-Hang Zhang,1,∗ Chesson Sipling,1,† and Massimiliano Di Ventra1,‡ 1Department of Physics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093 Recent research has shown that memory, in the form of slow degrees of freedom, can induce a phase of long-range order (LRO) in locally-coupled fast degrees of freedom, producing power-law distributions of avalanches. In fact, such memory-induced LRO (MILRO) arises in a wide range of physical systems. Here, we show that MILRO can be transferred to coupled systems that have no memory of their own. As an example, we consider a stack of layers of spins with local feedforward couplings: onlythefirstlayercontainsmemory,whiledownstreamlayersarememory-freeandlocally interacting. Analytical arguments and simulations reveal that MILRO can indeed drag across the layers, enabling downstream layers to sustain intra-layer LRO despite having neither memory nor long-rangeinteractions. Thisestablishesasimple,yetgenericmechanismforpropagatingcollective activitythroughmediawithoutfinetuningtocriticality,withtestableimplicationsforneuromorphic systems and laminar information flow in the brain cortex.

We notice that, in both layers, scale-free avalanche distributions exist which collapse well under finite-size scaling (shown in the insets). Furthermore, the scaling exponents in these distributions are nearly identical. This suggests that the collective, LRO state is effectively transferred from the base layer k=0 to the k=1 layer due to the inter-layer interactions. Both layers are simulated over 100 instances for T =200 simulation time (a.u.), with γ =0.2 and J⊥ =3.5. III.

This is in stark contrast with the short-ranged region, in which avalanches above size 10 are already quite rare; see Fig. 3(a). Additionally, thiscrossoverregionappearstoshrinkquiteslowlywhen comparing deeper layers. Lastly, we must emphasize that for J⊥/J > 4 the inter-layertermalwaysdominatesanddownstreamlayers largely follow the base layer’s dynamics, causing inter- layer synchronizations. This is precisely why the LRO region saturates in size after a few layers (see the simi- larity between Layer 5 and 10 in Fig. 3(b)).

Appendix B: Numerical details We simulate Eqn. 1 on k square layers of size L×L stacked along the feedforward direction. Unless stated otherwise, open boundaries are used in-plane and all parameters are homogeneous within a layer. Time evolution is integrated with a fixed–step, fourth–order Runge–Kutta scheme using ∆t = 0.048γ1/3, which re- solves both the fast spin dynamics and the slow mem- ory dynamics over the range of γ explored. To elimi- nate transients, we discard the first 103 steps and record the subsequent trajectory for avalanche analysis.

Consequently,power–lawregimesseenin2Darereplaced bydistributionsdominatedbysystem–wideeventsin3D. At intermediate couplings, two trends appear: For J⊥ ≲ 2, vertical links are too weak to fully synchronize layers. Avalanches remain predominantly lateral, and the 3D distributions recover a broad algebraic regime (LRO), similar to the in–plane case. For J⊥ > 2 but γ ∼ 1, memory weakens while vertical links are mod- erately strong; partial inter-layer merging also produces power-law distributions of avalanches corresponding to LRO. As γ increases further, activity becomes sparse, producing a crossover regime which eventually gives way to short–range behavior when γ is too large. Taken together, the 3D clusters make explicit the mechanism behind MILRO drag: vertical coupling links together correlated planes. When J⊥ is strong, this ef- fect yields stack–spanning events (rigidity); when mod- erate, it transmits order without full synchronization (LRO/crossover); and when weak, layers decouple and only small clusters survive. --- Page 13 --- 13 Rigid Long-range order Crossover Short-range correlations FIG. 10.
