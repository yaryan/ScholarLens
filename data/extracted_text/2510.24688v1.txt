Sensors deployed at intersections, crosswalks, and merging zones offer a strategic advantage for observing traffic participants from elevated viewpoints, providing broader and more stable observations. This spatial advantage facilitates long-term monitoring and enhances the ability to detect dynamic objects [4]. Although LiDAR sensors have been widely adopted for infrastructure- basedobjectdetectionduetotheiraccurate3Dmeasurements, they remain costly, maintenance-intensive, and sensitive to mounting and calibration errors [5]–[7]. In contrast, cameras are significantly more affordable, scalable, and easier to de- ploy.
